# Unique Password Generator

 This application generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. The script uses four arrays for each of the selected criteria, while a for loop combines each of the selected criteria and selects a character randomly for each one. The password is then logged via console, and posted to the textarea element for the user to copy.
